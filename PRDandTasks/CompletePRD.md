# Product Requirements Document (PRD)
## Resource Discovery Platform

## Project Overview

This Next.js website is a centralized platform for discovering tools, software, code snippets, and libraries across web development, design, and various industries. It targets users seeking curated, easily searchable resources with rich categorization and external links, providing a modern and efficient alternative to scattered resource discovery across multiple platforms.

## Problem & Solution Summary

Users often struggle to find trustworthy, up-to-date tools and resources due to scattered information, unreliable recommendations, and platform algorithm limitations. This website solves these issues by aggregating, curating, and categorizing resources, enabling efficient discovery and reducing time spent searching across multiple platforms and sources through a unified, searchable interface.

## Target Users

- **Website and app developers** (coding and no-code) seeking development tools, frameworks, and code libraries
- **Designers** (UI/UX, graphic, web) looking for design tools, inspiration, and resources  
- **Small business owners and entrepreneurs** needing business tools and software solutions
- **Freelancers and consultants** requiring project management and productivity tools
- **Hobbyists and learners** exploring new industries and seeking educational resources
- **Technical professionals** seeking reliable, curated resources for specific technical needs

### User Access Levels
- **Guest Users:** Browse, search, and view resource details
- **Authenticated Users:** All guest features plus favorites management and resource submissions (future)
- **Admin Users:** Full content management, user administration, and system configuration
- **Moderators:** Content review and approval capabilities

## Deliverables
